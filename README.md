# min-energy-path-planning

metpsr.py file contains the class for minimum energy calculation. Define appropriate metrics in the robot parameters to generate a cost_map.pkl file according to your problem. 

## Path Planning
For all the path planning algorithms, use
```
python3 algorithm_name.py
```

NOTE: To benchmark the time, set the `show_animation` flag to `False`
